OPTIONS

-l
--local

When the repository to clone from is on a local machine, this flag bypasses the normal "Git aware" transport mechanism
 and clones the repository by making a copy of HEAD and everything under objects and refs directories. 
 The files under .git/objects/ directory are hardlinked to save space when possible.
